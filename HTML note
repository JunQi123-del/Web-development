HTML note

Element vs Tag

Tag = <h1> </h1>

Basically the entire thing.
Element = <h1>Example</h1>

Header:
Best not to have more than 1 <h1></h1> in a html file.
Dont skip one level of header.

Void element = forbidden to put any content inside the tag " "

Horizontal rule = one horizontal line <hr/> 
break = have the next sentence go to the next line <br/>
